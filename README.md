# Greenhouse-Gas-Emission-Prediction-Week-1-
 This project is  focused on applying Artificial Intelligence to real-world environmental problems.  In Week 1, we explored and analyzed greenhouse gas emission data from the U.S. supply chain using data provided in Excel format. Our objective is to understand the structure, trends, and insights from emissions data over multiple years.
