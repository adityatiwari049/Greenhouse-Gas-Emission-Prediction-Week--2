Greenhouse-Gas-Emission-Prediction
This project focuses on applying Artificial Intelligence to real-world environmental problems.

Week 1
In Week 1, we explored and analyzed greenhouse gas emission data from the U.S. supply chain using data provided in Excel format. Our objective was to understand the structure, trends, and insights from emissions data over multiple years.

Week 2
In Week 2, we extended our analysis by cleaning and preprocessing the data. This included handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key emission contributors. We also visualized the distribution of emissions and examined the top emitting industries to prepare the dataset for machine learning models.
